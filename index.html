              Hey! I'm
              <strong>Ryder Reid</strong>
              and I'm 13 Years Old and running for the 2023 Young Mayor of Horsham Victoria. I believe
              I could make some helpful and useful changes while being a Candidate for the Horsham Youth Council as I
              have many friends that have always asked for many changes and including myself to be made in Horsham. But
              these changes have never happened. This is why I believe I could make some of these changes a reality,
              even if it is something small I believe it could make a big impact on my friends and also the community.

              But the main reason I am running for Young Mayor of Horsham is because in my opinion I believe that our council does nothing for teenagers, there is nothing for us
              that we can even use, the council does various projects for the Younger and Older Range of Horsham but never for teenagers. Which is why I am running for Youth Mayor.

          If I am elected to be Horsham's Young Mayor I will deticate
          my time to the Horsham Community, by addressing known issues
          in the Horsham Community and listening to the younger side of the
          community. I believe that younger people should always have an
          opinion when it comes to changes in their Community, if I am elected
          I will help improve the commuication with younger members of the community 
          and bring issues that they may have. I believe this is important as 
          many younger people do not have a opinion on the changes of Horsham.
          I hope I can make important changes to this community, while working
          with the older memebers of the Horsham Rurial City Council.

              Summertime is the best time to go outside with your friends and
              go for a swim after a 40 Degree Day. But many Kids/Teens seem to just
              stay inside on their phone not social interacting because there is nothing
              to do at the Wimmera River than swim, plus the Wimmer River is one of the 
              only places to swim for free in Horsham. They're a few Rope Swings but they're
              placed by Members of the Community but they're usually packed with tons of
              people trying to cool off and have fun. I would like to try and add more
              activities like this along the Wimmera River.

            <p class="projects__row-content-desc">
              This is one that my friends personally complain about the most. I have shown a picture of 
              the Horsham Skate Park Bike Jumps which are just disapointing at best, how does this show
              new families of Horsham what our citizens do in their free time if there is just big piles of
              dirt "acting" as Bike Jumps.

              It has came to a point where people have been making Bike Jumps all over Horsham, just for the 
              council to remove then a week later. This started the Burnt Creek Bike Jumps over near Burnt Creek
              in Horsham where many people go to. But why should us Teenagers and some Adults have to build our
              own, why can't our Council listen to us and build an area for people to ride? This would be one of
              the harder projects to get done but I believe with hard work this could be done.

              This is one of the more important projects I would do if I was Young Mayor. I have a Picture Showing a
              dangerous crossings on the left. Many cars go through the intersection everyday and also do pedestrians, but
              for pedestrians this crossing is not safe, because of the amount cars travelling through everday it can get very busy.
              So if a pedestrian was crossing they have to wait a rediculously long time and then risk the chance of getting hit
              by a car. I would like to replace these intersection roundabouts with Traffic Lights to help pedestrians cross safely.
