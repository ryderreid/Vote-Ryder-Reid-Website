              Hey! I'm
              <strong>Ryder Reid</strong>
              at the age of 14, I am actively participating in the 2023 Young Mayor campaign for Horsham, Victoria. My
              motivation stems from the belief that I can bring about meaningful and beneficial changes as a candidate
              for the Horsham Youth Council. Many of my friends and I have expressed the need for numerous improvements
              within our community, but these requests have remained unaddressed. This is precisely why I have the
              confidence to turn some of these desired changes into reality. Even if they are seemingly small in scale,
              I firmly believe they can have a significant impact on my friends and the overall community.

              One of the primary reasons behind my candidacy for the position of Young Mayor of Horsham is my
              observation that the current council fails to address the needs of teenagers like myself. It appears that
              there are limited resources and initiatives specifically tailored to our age group. While the council
              undertakes projects aimed at younger and older demographics, teenagers are often left with a lack of
              options. This realization serves as a driving force for my decision to run for the position of Youth
              Mayor.

              A voting location is where eligible citizens cast their votes, enabling democratic participation. These

          If I am elected as Horsham's Young Mayor, I will wholeheartedly dedicate my time and effort to serving the
          Horsham community. My focus will be on addressing the well-known issues that exist within our community and
          giving a voice to the younger generation. I strongly believe that young people should always be included in
          discussions regarding changes in their community. If I have the privilege of being elected, I will strive to
          improve communication with younger members of the community and actively seek out the issues they face. It is
          crucial to ensure that the younger population has a say in shaping the future of Horsham.

              During the summer, it's great to enjoy the outdoors with friends and cool off with a swim after a hot day.
              However, many kids and teens opt to stay inside and use their phones because there aren't many activities
              available at the Wimmera River besides swimming. The river is one of the few free swimming spots in
              Horsham, but the existing rope swings, installed by community members, are often crowded. To address this,
              I aim to introduce additional activities along the Wimmera River to encourage social interaction and fun.
              By diversifying the options, we can provide more opportunities for young people to enjoy the river and
              make the most of summer.

            <p class="projects__row-content-desc">
              One issue that my friends frequently complain about is the state of the Horsham Skate Park Bike Jumps. The
              current jumps are disappointing, consisting of mere piles of dirt. This situation fails to showcase to new
              families in Horsham how our citizens spend their free time. Additionally, individuals have resorted to
              building their own bike jumps throughout Horsham, only to have them removed by the council a week later.
              This led to the creation of the Burnt Creek Bike Jumps near Burnt Creek in Horsham, where many people
              gather. However, it is unfair that teenagers and some adults have to construct their own jumps. Why can't
              our council listen to our needs and create a designated area for riding? While this project may pose
              challenges, I believe that with diligent effort, it can be accomplished.

            <h3 class="projects__row-content-title">Dangerous Crossings</h3>
            <p class="projects__row-content-desc">
              One of the significant projects I would prioritize as Young Mayor is addressing the dangerous crossings,
              as depicted in the picture on the left. With numerous cars and pedestrians passing through this
              intersection daily, it poses a safety concern for pedestrians. The high volume of traffic often results in
              congestion, making it challenging for pedestrians to cross safely. Currently, they must endure long
              waiting times and risk the possibility of getting hit by a car.

              To enhance pedestrian safety, I propose replacing the existing roundabouts at these intersections with
              zebra crossings. This change would provide a designated and clearly marked path for pedestrians to cross,
              ensuring their safety and reducing the potential for accidents. By implementing zebra crossings, we can
              create a more pedestrian-friendly environment, allowing individuals to cross with confidence and
              convenience.

              Improving the safety of these crossings is an essential step towards creating a more secure and accessible
              community for all. As Young Mayor, I would prioritize this project and work towards implementing the
              necessary changes to protect pedestrians and enhance their overall experience.
